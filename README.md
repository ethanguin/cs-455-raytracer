# cs-455-raytracer
Repo for my raytracer code in cs455 at BYU

My goal for 455 is to get a basic raytracer that renders spheres with a basic lambert shader. I'm structuring it in such a way that I can continue to add features (polygon rendering, texture mapping, soft shadows, GPU rendering) without having to rewrite my base classes and algorithms.

In 655, I plan to extend this raytracer to a full pathtracer (render interreflections and interdiffuse lighting) and I hope to add GPU computation to speed up the rendering. I'll also look for other ways that I can speed up the process and optimize my raytracer.
